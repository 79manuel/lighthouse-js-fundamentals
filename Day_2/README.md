# 1. Rolling Dice
Write a program that takes a single parameter from the command line, a number, and rolls that many six-sided dice.
For example, the following is a sample output of the program.
```
> node dice-roller.js 3
Rolled 3 dice: 2, 6, 5
```

## Tips
To generate a random number, you'll have to use the built-in Math.random.
